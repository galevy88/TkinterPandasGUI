# TkinterPandasGUI

This code was created in order to tagging cells that represent potassium ion channels on their membrane. 
The scripts fetch graphs made by matplotlib as a visualize way to distinguish between good experimental data to bad experimental data.
After the tagging phase the good experimental meta data convert into CSV file for continued future work.
